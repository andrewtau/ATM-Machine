# ATM-Machine
This was an interview project that was given to me. The goal was to create a simple ATM machine with these requirements. 
  • Checking whether an input – such as an ATM card (a debit/credit card number) – is recorded correctly 
  • Verifying the user by asking for a PIN • In case of negative verification, logging out the user 
  • In case of positive verification, showing multiple options, including cash availability, the previous five transactions, and cash withdrawal 
  • Giving the user the ability to withdraw up to $1,000 worth of cash in one transaction, with total transactions limited to ten per day.
